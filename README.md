# RPA Studio Fundamentals

### Description:
The following assignment was designed to assess trainees' abilities in UiPath Studio, with a focus on variables and foundational concepts of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) while making sure to follow UiPath best practices and conventions. See my solution in the screenshots & .xaml file ðŸ¤“.

### Task 1.0: Creating and Initializing Variables
  1. Create an automation project in UiPath Studio. 
  2. Design a workflow that prompts the user to enter their name. 
  3. Create a variable called "userName" to store the user's name. 
  4. Use an input dialog activity to capture the user's name and assign it to the "userName" variable. 
  5. Display a message box with a personalized greeting using the "userName" variable.

### Task 1.1: Utilizing Variables in Automation Logic 
  1. Design a workflow that performs a simple mathematical calculation. 
  2. Create variables for two numbers, "num1" and "num2," and initialize them with any values. 
  3. Implement a calculation using these variables (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). 
  4. Store the result in a variable called "result." 5. Display the "result" variable using a message box activity.

### Task 1.2: Working with RPA Concepts 
  1. Design a workflow that automates a repetitive task. 
  2. Identify a simple task that can be automated, such as renaming a file or copying data fromone application to another. 
  3. Implement the automation using appropriate UiPath activities and actions. 
  4. Ensure that the automation handles potential exceptions or errors gracefully. 
  5. Run the automation and verify its successful execution.
